The Goal of the game is to move along the board
until you reach the 100th space, or landing on the
ladder located on the 80th space.
You reach the goal by rolling a 6 sided die.
You move spaces on the board equal to amount
indicated on the die. The board moves snake-like,
meaning that when you reach the end of the board
you move up a row and move in the other direction.
If you are in the last row and roll a number that
will put you higher than the 100th space, you
will move accordingly until you reach the 100th
space, then move backwards the rest of the way.
Landing on a Ladder will benefit you and move you
up the board, while Chutes make you slide down.
WARNING: Games can end up being extremely long if
         you are extremely unlucky.
